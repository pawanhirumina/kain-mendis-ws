# Kain Mendis Website

## Project Overview

I designed and developed a sleek, modern website for Kain Mendis, an emerging musician passionate about creating heartfelt and inspiring music. The website was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my front-end development skills and design sensibilities.

## Website Features

### Elegant Design
- **Dark Theme**: Sophisticated black background with focused content areas
- **Split-Screen Hero Section**: Artistic dual-image layout featuring the artist
- **Minimalist Aesthetics**: Clean typography and ample white space
- **High-Contrast Elements**: Blue CTA buttons that stand out against the dark background

### Sections & Content
- **Hero Welcome**: Engaging introduction with clear value proposition
- **About Me**: Personal artist statement describing Kain's musical journey and philosophy
- **Music Player**: Interactive music section with multiple tracks:
  - Vikara (2:52)
  - Suranganaviyak (2:48)
  - Wishwasaya (3:08)
  - Virahawa (2:44)
- **Contact Form**: User-friendly form with name, email, and message fields
- **Footer**: Copyright information and social media navigation

### Interactive Elements

### User Experience

- **Visual Storytelling**: Images and text work together to convey the artist's identity
- **Focused Content**: Prioritizes essential information without overwhelming the visitor

## Design Choices

### Typography
- Clean, modern sans-serif fonts for readability
- Varied text weights to establish visual hierarchy
- Consistent text styling throughout for brand cohesion

### Color Scheme
- Primary: Dark background (#111111 or similar)
- Accent: Bright blue (#0066FF or similar) for call-to-action elements
- Text: White and light gray for optimal readability against dark background

### Layout
- Single-page design with clearly defined sections
- Strategic use of white space to prevent visual clutter
- Balanced composition between text and visual elements

## Development Process

1. **Development**: Hand-coded the entire website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. **Testing**: Ensured functionality across devices and browsers
3. **Deployment**: Published the website at www.kainmendis.online

## Future Enhancements

Based on the current design, potential future improvements could include:
